# OldPhonePadIronSoftware

Implementation for old phone pad coding challange by Iron Software.

## Problem Statement

![Old Mobile Keypad](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Telephone-keypad2.svg/300px-Telephone-keypad2.svg.png)

Here is an old phone keypad with alphabetical letters, a backspace key, and a send button.
Each button has a number to identify it and pressing a button multiple times will cycle 
through the letters on it allowingeach button to represent more than one letter.
For example, pressing 2 once will return ‚ÄòA‚Äô but pressing twicein succession will return ‚ÄòB‚Äô.
You must pause for a second in order to type two characters from the same button after each 
other: ‚Äú222 2 22‚Äù -> ‚ÄúCAB‚Äù.
